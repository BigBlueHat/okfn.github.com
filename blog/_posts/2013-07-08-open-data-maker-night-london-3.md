### What

Open Data Maker Nights are informal events focused on "making" with open data – whether that's creating apps or insights. They aren't a general meetup -- if you come, expect to get pulled into actually building something, though we won't force you!

### Who

The events usually have short introductory talks about specific projects and suggestions for things to work on – it’s absolutely fine to turn up knowing nothing about data or openness or tech as, there’ll an activity for you to help and someone to guide you in contributing!
