The Open Definition

<h4>Description:</h4>

The Open Definition sets out principles to define ‘openness’ in relation to content and data – that’s any kind of material or data ‘from sonnets to statistics, genes to geodata’. The definition can be summed up in the statement that “A piece of content or data is open if anyone is free to use, reuse, and redistribute it — subject only, at most, to the requirement to attribute and share-alike.”.
