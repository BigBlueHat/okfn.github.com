Public Domain Works: A large database of works which are in the public domain in different countries.

Public Domain Calculators: A set of tools to help determine which works are in the public domain in countries around the world.

The Public Domain Review: A web based review of public domain works.

These projects are coordinated and maintained by the Working Group on the Public Domain. Discussion of all of these projects takes place on the pd-discuss mailing list.
