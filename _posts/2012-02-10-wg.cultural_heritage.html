<h1>Working Group - Cultural Heritage RETIRED</h1>

<h4>Strapline:</h4>

Working Group for those interested in Open Heritage

<h4>Description:</h4>

Knowledge of our cultural heritage is captured today by a massive variety of organisations and people. These range from traditional museums to hyperlocal websites and private collections of scanned photos shared via services like flickr. 
In order to try and better engage with the richness of the cultural sector , the OKFN has set up a Cultural Heritage working group and invites participation from anyone with interest in the domain. Our goal is not to compete with existing technical or policy forums, but to promote sharing of information and best practice about the opening up of our cultural heritage. Weâ€™re aiming to do this by providing a forum in which anyone interested can exchange ideas or make announcements.
