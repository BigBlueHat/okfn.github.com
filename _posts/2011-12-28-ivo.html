<h1>Ivo of Chartres</h1>

<h4>Strapline:</h4>

This site has four elements - draft texts and some concordances for the three collections traditionally associated with Ivo of Chartres, the Collectio Tripartita, the Decretum and the Panormia, and a draft list of manuscripts which contain a significant number of Ivo’s letters.

<h4>Description:</h4>

The purpose of making such provisional texts available, with all their errors and gaps, is to encourage others to correct and develop what we have done for the common profit. It is our hope that the collaborative work of other scholars will over time convert these first sketches into a solid body of secure learning.
