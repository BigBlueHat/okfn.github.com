Open Data Maker Nights are informal events focused on "making" with open data – whether that's creating apps or insights. They aren't a general meetup -- if you come, expect to get pulled into actually building something, though we won’t force you!

The events usually have short introductory talks about specific projects and suggestions for things to work on - it's absolutely fine to turn up knowing nothing about data or openness or tech as, there'll an activity for you to help and someone to guide you in contributing!

## Organize Your Own

Like our general meetups we encourage community members to start their own - all you need is enthusiasm! Here's how:

* Head over to the [Open Knowledge Foundation Meetup Everywhere page][meetup]
* Create a new meetup in your location with title "Open Data Maker Night" (you'll need to login)
* Add some info (you could copy and paste the outline above)
* Invite people!
