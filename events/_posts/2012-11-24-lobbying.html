      How EU money is spent is an issue that concerns everyone who pays
      taxes to the EU. As the influence of Brussels lobbyists grows, it
      is increasingly important to draw the connections between
      lobbying, policy-making and funding. Journalists and activists
      need browsable databases, tools and platforms to investigate
      lobbyistsâ€™ influence and where the money goes in the EU. Join us
      and help build these tools! :w
