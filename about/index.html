    <h1>What is Labs?</h1>

    <p>
    <span class="minipic-wrapper"><img class="chaos minipic" src="/img/chaos.png"></span>
    We're a community interested in using technology and data to help make government more accountable, culture more accessible and science more efficient. We focus on making things - whether thatâ€™s apps, insights or tools. We have a strong preference for <a href="http://opendefinition.org/">open data</a> and <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free</a> / <a href="http://opensource.org/">open source software</a>.</p>
    </p>

    <p>In short we're civic hackers, data wranglers and ordinary citizens intrigued and excited by the possibilities of combining technology and information for good.</p>

    <p>
    We're part of the <a href="http://okfn.org/">Open Knowledge Foundation Network</a> and operate as a collaborative community which anyone can join in. You don't need to be an uber-geek to participate: interest and a willingness to get your hands dirty (digitally) be that with making, testing or helping is all that's needed - though we do allow lurking on the <a href="/contact/">mailing list</a> ;-).
