<h1>What is Labs?</h1>

<p>
<span class="minipic-wrapper"><img class="chaos minipic" src="/img/chaos.png"></span>
<p>We're a community of civic hackers, data wranglers and ordinary citizens intrigued and excited by the possibilities of combining technology and information for good &ndash; making government more accountable, culture more accessible and science more efficient.</p>

<p>We focus on making things - whether thatâ€™s apps, insights or tools. We have a strong preference for <a href="http://opendefinition.org/">open data</a> and <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free</a> / <a href="http://opensource.org/">open source software</a>.</p>
</p>

<p>
We're part of the <a href="http://okfn.org/">Open Knowledge Foundation Network</a> and operate as a collaborative community which anyone can join.</p>

<p>You don't need to be an uber-geek to participate: interest and a willingness to get your hands dirty (digitally) be that with making, testing or helping is all that's needed - though we do allow lurking on the <a href="/contact/">mailing list</a> ;-).
</p>

<h2>Principles</h2>
<p>We have some simple community principles that outline how we function and
which act as a guide for community members.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Openness</strong>: <a href="http://opendefinition.org/">open
data, open content</a>, and <a href="http://opensource.org/">open tools</a>. In
Labs we only make open stuff. We also have a strong preference for
<em>using</em> open stuff but we aren't obsessed about this &ndash; if Excel or
Google Docs or [insert tool] is what you use to get the job done that's
ok!</li>
  <li><strong>Positive and welcoming</strong>: We're friendly to newcomers and old hands alike.
Everyone was new once (and sought to reinvent the wheel!). Enthusiasm and
support for others at all levels of skill and experience is important.</li>
  <li><strong>Doing</strong>: we're focused on the concrete not the abstract, making not
theorizing.</li>
  <li><strong>Insights as well as apps</strong>: insights, analysis, and
stories may be just as valuable as the tools and the apps.</li>
  <li><strong>More than code</strong>: designing, testing, documenting, wrangling are
just as valued as coding.</li>
  <li><strong>Informal</strong>: we don't get caught up in formal processes or hierarchies. We
only have process where its essential, or authority where it matters such as
access to limited resources, management of shared infrastructure</li>
</ul>
